## Immediate Goals
- Custom text-based query tool? (e.g. "Good places for wakeboarding that speak english") - Request from Paul. Add to top of explore page. Might need to send to AI, with some data about the table structure, and user preferences, to design a custom query, then reflect that in the UI.
- Add a toggle to set travel budget as being per week, per month, or per year when inputting the data.
- Remove AI search from all pages except Explore Destinations
- Allow the Transport budget to have start and end dates, using same widget construction as Annual Budget

- Add a search bar for medicine rules for each country (E.g. what can you bring in, how much, etc), with no information storage
- Add start and end dates for transport budget
- Add fuzzy search to the AI search bar (when using Non-AI functionality) - So that results update as letters are entered
- If user searches an interest in interest filter and presses Control+enter, add that interest to the interest list
- Allow user to define their own events data, then display it in the events widget on the "explore page". Add an events tab to the top navigation bar.
