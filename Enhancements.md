# Enhancements Backlog

## Issues
- 

## Immediate Goals
- Custom text-based query tool? (e.g. "Good places for wakeboarding that speak english") - Request from Paul. Add to top of explore page. Might need to send to AI, with some data about the table structure, and user preferences, to design a custom query, then reflect that in the UI.
- Make dates for budgets optional, so basic users can set them without confirming dates
- Add metric vs imperial toggle to configuration page
- Move the search bar to the top of the explore page, below the "Explore Destinations" heading and subheading.
- Add a toggle to set travel budget as being per week, per month, or per year when inputting the data.
- Rename "travel budget" to "transport budget"
- Remove AI search from all pages except Explore Destinations
- Add expense tracking so people can better estimate costs for themselves in specific locations?
- Add an experience wishlist brainstorm chatbot?
- Add "favourite” tags to all filter lists
- Add medicine rules for each country (E.g. what can you bring in, how much, etc)
- Have users add their current medications in config page.
- Add fuzzy search to all filter lists
- Add start and end dates for transport budget
- All forms should submit on press "enter"
- Add dosing (with dose unit dropdown) and prescription end date (optional) to medication list
- Add a "favourites" tag to the sort list (just puts favs first)
- Change "favourite" star to a heart - Minimal colour design if possible
