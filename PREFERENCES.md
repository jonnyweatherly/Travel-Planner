For all projects

Generally, parameters should go in a .config.txt file. Create this if it is missing.

When developing any script, to make it easier to test, include the following:

Include an example I can use to test the script at the top of the file

Include a list of all parameters and references to any sample data if present, near the top of the script, below the example

When creating html files, add them to the gitignore file

Always refer to API keys via .env
